## Assignment

**Objective:**

Create a responsive landing page for a website. The landing page should include a header with a mega menu, a product comparison table with advanced features, a wizard form, and a footer. 

**Instructions:**

1. **Header with Mega Menu**:
    - Create a header section at the top of the page.
    - Include the company's logo on the left side.
    - Implement a mega menu that appears on hover/click on the main navigation items. [ **This is an optional task, but it is a bonus in grading. If time does not allow, do it using the regular menu]
    - Ensure the mega menu is responsive and user-friendly.
    
2. **Product Comparison Table**:
    - Below the header, add a section with a product comparison table.
    - The table should compare at least 4 products.
    - Include columns for product names, subtitles, or subheadings (short descriptions of the product), prices with the Add to Cart button, and features.
    - **Sticky Header**: Implement a sticky header for the table so that the header remains visible when scrolling.
    - **Tooltips**: Add tooltips to explain features or provide additional information when users hover over certain cells (Do not add a tooltip to all cells, only 1-2 will work).
    - **Views**:
      - **Desktop**: Standard table view.
      - **Mobile**: Use a slider/carousel view where users can swipe left or right to view different products.
    - Ensure the table is responsive and fits well on both desktop tabs and mobile screens.
      
3. **Wizard Form**:
    - Below the product comparison table, add a wizard form.
    - The form should guide the user through 3 steps:
      1. **Personal Information**: Collect name, email, and phone number.
      2. **Product Preferences**: Allow users to select product categories they are interested in.
      3. **Review & Submit**: Display a summary of the information entered and a submit button.
    - Validate the form fields at each step.
    - Ensure the form is responsive and user-friendly.
    - **Add Animation**: Add smooth transitions between steps, such as sliding or fading effects.
    
4. **Footer**:
    - As time allows, you can create a footer section at the bottom of the page with or without links.
    - Ensure the footer is responsive.
      
5. **Creative Touch**:
    - **Use Your Best Creativity**: Think outside the box and add creative elements to make the landing page stand out. This could be :
      - Custom graphics or illustrations. 
      -  Subtle animations that enhance the user experience without being distracting.
      - Interactive elements, such as tooltips, modals, or pop-ups, engage the user.
      - You can add functionalities, such as making the login button work (frontend only) and showing cart items when the login is done.
      - Anything else that you think will make the page a better experience for the user

**Requirements:**

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Use HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Avoid using CSS & JS libraries, use vanilla JS & CSS only.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the landing page is fully responsive and works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: The page should be tested and compatible with the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

**Submission:**

- **Code Repository**: Push your project to a GitHub repository owned by you, and add  idteam-at-onecom as a collaborator in that repo.
- **Live Demo**: Live demo during the panel interview
- **README**: Include a README file in your repository with:
  - A brief description of your project.
  - Instructions on how to run the project locally.
  - Are there any additional notes or features you implemented?


## FAQs

Q: Where do I have to solve the assignment?

A: Implement it on your local system or use any virtual server on cloud/VPS, etc. We will need this system again during panel interview, so do not destroy your work.

Q: Do I have to use a particular operating system?

A: It is up to you to choose operating system of your choice.

Q: Can I make the repository public?

A: No, you should not do that.

Q: Can I purge stuff on my system once changes are pushed to repo?

A: No, you should not do that. If you are selected for the panel interview, then the panel will ask you to show it live.
